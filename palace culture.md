You don’t even need to go to ancient times. Look at back just under 100 years. When I toured Hearst Castle, the monumentous[sic] property built in 1919 William Randolph Hearst, I felt no envy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
He got news from around the world, but only because he had newspapers flown in. I get instant world news in my pocket.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He had a GIANT kitchen and a full time kitchen staff, but was limited by the food he could get into San Simeon and safely store. The food supply chain was not nearly as good, and food was limited by spoilage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
He could travel, but I can travel further, farther and cheaper thanks to jet aircraft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
He had a telephone, but he could not video conference with people. He could not send instant messages; he was constrained by the speed of the post office or the ability to find a land line or radio near the person he wanted to speak with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
If he wanted to listen to music, he could hire an orchestra, listen to records, or maybe the radio. He did not have the gigantic jukebox in the sky that I do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
He night be able to receive TV where he was, but barely. I have an endless trough of video entertainment at my disposal for a tiny sum of money.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Hearst castle gets COLD. He had fireplaces everywhere, and later electric heat. I will take central forced-air heating and A/C every day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
And ANCIENT times? Fuhgettaboutit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
No vaccines. Hello polio! Hello smallpox! Hello measles!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
No antibiotics. One good infection buts you on the wrong side of the grass.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Indoor plumbing. Need I say more?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Transport by… horse. I prefer that my mode of transportation have no opinion about where I am going.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Indoor electric lighting. Soot gets old, fast.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Comfortable furniture. No wood, stone, or hay for me, thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Phenomenal textiles. The cheapest modern cotton shirt is unmatched by any ancient textile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Mirrors and Glass. The most expensive silver mirror in an ancient castle is laughably poor compared optical quality compared to the cheapest mirror you can get at WalMart. Windows and fine mesh screens are pretty awesome, too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Mass production, mass transportation, functioning governments, excellent public safety, steelwork, fuel, electricity, pipelines, flood control, highways, mass agriculture. The 21st century RULES.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Oh yeah. I almost forgot pre-sliced bread. Is that the greatest invention, or what? &lt;&lt;</p>

<p>Not even the grandeur of the Hearst Castle in San Simeon can live up to the expectations of this person. Everything in this man’'s life is supposedly superior to what William Randoplh Hearst was able to acquire despite the latter’'s shrewd business decisions and high stakes risk taking.<br><br>
<em><br>
<em>The FOOD omg!</em><br><br>
<em></em><br>
<em>Muh smartphone!</em><br><br>
<em></em><br>
<em>Air conditioning!</em><br><br>
<em></em><br>
*Airline travel to holiday destinations!</em></p>
<p>*
</p><p>Such highly desensitized individuals fail to grasp many things to be sure, but the most profound aspect of this question - ““would you rather live as a king in ancient times or a normal person in 21st Century?”” is the proliferation and democratization of what I call “Palace Culture”.<br><br>
By <strong><br>
By <strong>palace culture</strong></strong> I don’'t mean just the material artefacts of royal status, but also the sensibilities of court life. You could call it the entitlement culture of high society.<br><br>
Let’'s look at the similarities between the modern urban affluent lifestyle and pre modern palace culture:<br><br>
Similar to the royalty the modern swipple middle class man moves around shifting his residence to more accommodating locations depending on work situation or for holidays. And like the monarch, modern man has a court attending him. Everywhere he goes he demands access to FOOD:  Exotic savory meals to satiate his voracious appetite. Woe to those that disappoint His Majesty for they will receive a sharp rebuke on yelp (the stockade of the internet age), on facebook or other networks acting as bailiff in the service of His Individual Highness.<br><br>
Like the princes of yore, modern man travels to milder climates for those all important vacations when the weather at home becomes unpleasant, and like a prince there will be a court catering to him. Household staff is there to tend to his quarters, restricted access privilege (Do Not Disturb sign, VIP suites), servants at his beck and call (room service), concubines to satisfy his sexual needs i.e. sex vacations to Brazil or South East Asia, or merely an unending loop of whores streaming on his internet capable device. Not unlike the palace culture of King Louis XIV, the male Prince is stripped of his innocence at a young age. At the age of 15 Louis was thrust into the embrace of an older court lady to experience fornication, a custom that was widespread among the high nobility of Europe. Modern man will have had this kind of deflowering much sooner than his 15th year with the unrestrained access to high def internet porn commonly available nowadays.</p>
<p> 
</p><p>All this access to the accoutrements of court culture engenders sensibilities and tastes which are accommodating to this mindset. To allow these elite tastes to exist there has to be a cultivation of ‘‘tolerance’’ as the supreme ethic. The French court tolerated men seeking out other men for same sex relations (Louis XIV did actually try putting the brakes on this). And how could it be any different? Let me ask: Who among the elite is going to condemn such abominations when they themselves are engaged in debauchery? Modern man, by the time he has come of age, is likely already familiar with unusual sexual fetishes and has probably pleasured himself to several bizarre fantasy reenactments thanks to the internet (think BDSM, transsexualism, hentai).</p>

<p>
</p><p>The way out of these deeply unhealthy behavioral patterns goes through hard moral work, introspection and the abandonment of easy gratification. If you want to get specific we are talking about religion. Not unconnected, these concepts that I just mentioned are the permanent subject of jokes and ridicule that the “court jesters” are sanctioned to target. You already know the deputized and authorized jesters of whom I am talking (Colbert, Fallon, Schumer, Kimmel, John Oliver).<br><br>
The moral universe of the media is designed to keep middle class men on a continuous path of over consumption. This consumption apes the luxury and opulence of the palace setting, but without any of duties inherent in the system of nobility such as mutual loyalties. The whole luxury goods consumer experience becomes even shallower when compared to what the noble class had to endure in order to obtain the fruits of the aristocratic life. For instance, take the loot crate unboxing moron here<br><br>
